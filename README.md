# Hacker News Post Analysis
In this project, I am going to investigate [Hacker News posts data set on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). The project aims to answer how post creation time affects interactions?

As mentioned the data set taken from Kaggle, and it has been reduced from 300,000 rows to almost 20,000 rows by removing all submission that didn not receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining data.
